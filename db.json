    "CaseDescription": "At 14:35 UTC, the Secure Email Gateway (SEG) flagged an incoming email addressed to Jane Doe, a finance department employee, as suspicious. The email masqueraded as a legitimate internal communication from IT support, urging immediate action to prevent payroll interruptions. The email contained a subject line: 'URGENT: Payroll Update Required', a malicious hyperlink: 'http://malicious-domain.com/login', and a sender's display name: 'IT Support Team'. Jane Doe clicked the provided link, which redirected her to a phishing page imitating the company's single sign-on portal. The fake page collected her login credentials. After entering her credentials, Jane noticed irregularities and reported the incident to the IT Helpdesk. Simultaneously, the anomaly detection system flagged an unusual login attempt from an external IP address (203.0.113.45) to Jane Doe\u2019s account, originating from a geographic location in a foreign country not associated with her typical login activity.",
